* Course description
  This course serves as an introduction to politics in the United
  States. The course is broken into two parts. In the first half of
  the course, we will discuss the founding and the institutions that
  emerged from the Constitution. During the latter half of the
  semester, we will attempt to understand the public's role in
  American politics. At the completion of the course, students will be
  able to:

  1. Demonstrate a basic understanding of U.S. politics
  2. Participate knowledgeably in the American political process
  3. Critically examine key concepts from political science
* Assessment
  - Reaction Papers (20%) :: Two reaction papers are due throughout
       the course of the semester. These can be based on academic or
       civic events you attend, such as speakers on campus, or on
       academic journal articles. The subject should be cleared with
       me /before/ writing the paper. I will distribute information
       about events and articles periodically throughout the semester.
       The papers should be no longer than two pages in length and
       should be submitted through Canvas.
    - First reaction paper due: October 10, 2016
    - Second reaction paper due: December 2, 2016
  - Canvas quizzes (10%) :: There will be weekly quizzes on canvas.
       You have two attempts to do these quizzes so if you're not
       satisfied with your first attempt you may retake it.
  - In-class quizzes: (20%) :: Quizzes will be in class and
       closed-note. They will not be announced beforehand, so always
       be prepared. You should expect roughly one quiz every two
       weeks. I will drop your lowest grade.
  - Exams (2): (50%) :: There will be two exams, one midway through
       the semester and the other at the end. They will be in-class
       and closed-note. The second will not cover material from the
       first.
    - First exam: October 14, 2016
    - Second exam: December 5, 2016

    *now* if you have a conflict with one of the exams.
