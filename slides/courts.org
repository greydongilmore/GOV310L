* Judicial Process

** Types of disputes
- Criminal law :: Government charges an individual with a violation of
     a statue that has been enacted to protect the public health,
     safety, morals, or welfare
  - Defendants found guilty fined and/or sent to prison 
- Civil law :: Disputes between two parties (gvt can be one) where no
     crime is alleged 
  - Contracts and torts most common
  - Defendants who lose can't be fined or sent to jail but can be
    forced to pay damages 
- Public law :: cases that involve the rights of the citizens or
     powers of government 
  - Constitutional law
