* What is the media

** What is the media?
- Not a singular institutions (like Congress and the presidency)
- An industry
- Business model: develop and distribute (news) content
  - Make money through ads and subscription fees

** Media's market
- Try to reach as many people as possible
- Basically all homes have at least one TV
  - About 75% have internet access 

* Media as political institution

** Types of media
- Print
- Broadcast
- Internet
#+BEAMER: \pause
Which do you use most? 

** Print 
- More than a thousand daily newspapers in the US
- Historically a cheaper option that broadcast
- Very unregulated

** Print media 
- Newspapers hugely important
- Set the news agenda
- Provides details and context not usually seen in the short TV
  segments

** Print media troubles
- Many newspapers are in serious financial trouble
- Many (most?) newspapers will close over the next few years
- Remains to be seen whether the internet can replace them, especially
  with regard to local news coverage 

** Broadcast
- Historically more expensive than print
- Technological limitations forced the federal government to heavily
  regulate licenses for the broadcast spectrum

** Broadcast news
- More Americans get their news from TV than anywhere else
- Oftentimes programs provide less analysis than newspapers
- Radio
  - Talkshows (Rush Limbaugh, etc)
- Rise of /soft news/ and /infotainment/
** Rise of the internet
- Emerges as a form of communication in the mid-1990s
- Internet has displaced newspaper and radio in importance
- Since 2008

** Internet media
- Occupies a place between TV (short but constantly updated) and print
  (detailed but once per day)
- Allows people to get involved directly
- Becoming more popular
- People, media, candidates can all talk directly to each other
  - Hard to implement well

** Regulation of the media 
- US has fewer regulations than many other countries
  - Also no government-owned media outlets
- Print media has little regulation
- Government regulates both content and ownership of broadcast media

** Broadcast regulation
- Between 6am and 10pm, the FCC limits obscenity, indecency, and
  profanity on TV and radio
- The FCC attempted to limit ownership, but the 1996
  Telecommunications Act did away with that
  - Led to many mergers

** Equal time rule
- The *equal time rule* says that a broadcaster must provide
  candidates for political office equal opportunity to broadcast their
  message

** Right of rebuttal
- The *right of rebuttal* is an FCC regulation that gives individuals
  the opportunity to respond to personal attacks

** Fairness doctrine
- FCC requirement that broadcasters must provide time for opposing viewpoints
- No longer enforced by the FCC since there are so many stations

** Freedom of the press
- *Prior restraint*: an effort by a government agency to block the
  publication of material it deems harmful in some way (censorship)
- In the US, except under extraordinary circumstances, the First
  Amendment prohibits government from preventing

** Freedom of the press
- Situation: the NY Times acquires secret Defense Department documents
  from an opponent of the War who had obtained the documents illegally
- Should the NY Times be allowed to publish these documents?
#+BEAMER: \pause
- The Supreme Court said yes

** Freedom of the press 
- Other court decisions have ruled that network stations have the same
  protections as traditional print media

** Organization & ownership 
- ~2,000 TV stations, ~1,400 daily newspapers, 13,000+ radio stations
- 20 major TV networks
- Through the 80s, TV dominated by the big 3
- CNN gains substantial viewing in the 1990s
- FOX comes along shortly after

** Media concentration
- The US only has one wire service: AP
  - Reuters in Europe is similar
- Since 1996, many mergers and acquisitions
  - ABC bought by Disney
  - CNN bought by Time Warner
  - NBC bought by Comcast
  - FOX bought by Rupert Murdoch

** Media concentration
- Many point to the internet as being less concentrated than print and
  broadcast media
- But large corporations (e.g. Google) have a large presence on the
  internet and can effectively censor parts 

* What affects coverage?

** What affects coverage? 
- Journalists 
- Sources
- Consumers

** Journalists
- Historically publishers had lots of leeway in what they wanted reported
- Not the case as much today - business interests (money) tend to
  prevail
- Journalists have large leeway in interpretation of news stories

** Journalists and bias
- One worry is that journalism is biased for or against one party
#+BEAMER: \pause
- What do you think? 

** Journalists and bias
- Journalists tend to be Democratic and liberal in their personal
  beliefs
- But does this translate into their stories?

** Bias
- Little evidence that news stories are more or less positive (or
  negative) about one party or the other...
- However, some networks tend to use loaded words for one party more
  than the other
  - FOX and the Wall Street journal tend to be conservative
  - Most other major outlets lean slightly to the left
  - PBS leans neither way

** Bias
- Many journalists follow an ethical code requiring them to be fair
  and unbiased
- This may be shifting with the rise of FOX and MSNBC

** News sources 
- Leaks
- Press releases
- Hiring reporters

** Leaks 
- *News leak* - disclosure of confidential information to the media
- Sometimes are *whistle-blowers* - low-level workers aiming to call
  attention to improper behavior
- More often high-level officials who regularly leak information to
  the press
  - Establish relationship
  - Ensure the story is published on their terms

** Press releases
- Companies & politicians put out *press releases* that are basically
  pre-written news stories
- Newspapers often publish these with little or no revision
- Allows companies/politicians to control a story's context

** Hiring reporters
- Some governments/corporations pay reporters to write favorable
  things about them
- At best questionably ethical

** Consumers 
- Consumers tend to be middle-upper or upper class, so the news
  reports tend to cater to their interests

* Media effects

** Media effects
- Agenda setting
- Priming
- Framing 

** Agenda setting
- Media sets the agenda
- Decides what to cover, which side(s) of the story to focus on

** Priming 
- Prime people to think of a story in a certain light
- Cover the debt, then cover a welfare story
- This makes people think of welfare in terms of money and expenses

** Framing
- *Framing* theory states that an issue can be viewed from a variety
  of perspectives and have implications for multiple values and considerations
- Small changes in the presentation of an issue can produce large
  changes in opinion

** Framing examples

Do you favor or oppose allowing a hate group to hold a political
rally?[fn:1]
#+BEAMER: \pause

Given the importance of free speech - 85% favor
#+BEAMER: \pause

Given the risk of violence - 45% favor
