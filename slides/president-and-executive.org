  bill into law, usually concerned with how the president interprets
  the law

  unconstitutional with mixed success from the courts
- Others direct the executive branch to deal with the law in various ways
- Of questionable legal status even though used by all modern
  presidents

  - ... But hard to find a case where Congress wouldn't have acted
- The public interest
  - ... But presidents have particular interests as well
- Presidential power and democracy
  - ... But Congress may be more democratic

* The Executive Branch AKA the Bureaucracy 
** Why Bureaucracy?
- Bureaucracy - the structure of offices, tasks, rules, and principles
  of organization that are employed by all large-scale institutions to
  coordinate the work of their personnel 
- Bureaucracy is where government actually performs
  - Collecting garbage, policing, mailing Social Security checks, etc
- Routine ensures services are delivered regularly
** Bureaucracy enhances efficiency
- Generally pyramidal in shape
- Many workers at the bottom with fewest skills, specializations, and experience
- Fewer at top, tend to oversee a large number
** Bureaucracy enables government to operate
- Bureaucracy enables us to accomplish tasks that would
  otherwise be unimaginable
  - Dividing up tasks, matching them to an appropriately trained
  labor force, routinizing procedure, and providing right incentive
  structure
- Bureaucracies are insulated from politicians
** Bureaucrats fulfill important roles
- Bureaucrats implement laws
- Bureaucrats make and enforce rules
  - Rules issued provide more details and specifics about what a
    policy will actually mean
  - Have a brief period of public comment before going into effect
** Bureaucrats settle disputes
