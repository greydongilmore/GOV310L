* Introduction to politics
** What is government?
 #+BEAMER: \pause
 - The institutions and procedures through which a land and its people
   are ruled
 - These can be simple or complex

** Why government?
 - We're all farmers and one of us proposes to build an irrigation
   system. How do we decide what happens? Does it get built? Who pays
   for it? Who maintains it? 
 - Tragedy of the commons

** Functions of government
#+BEAMER: \pause
 - Maintain order
 - Protect property
 - Provide public goods
** The basic power of government
   Coercion!

** Who rules?
 - Autocracy :: rule by a single individual
 - Oligarchy :: rule by a small class of people (landowners, military
      officers, etc)
 - Democracy :: system that allows citizens to play a significant role
      in the governmental process, usually through selection of
      officials

** How do they govern?
 - Constitutional :: Formal and effective limits placed on government
 - Authoritarian :: No formal limits, but may be checked by other
      social forces (the church, for example)
 - Totalitarian :: No formal limits and the state seeks to expand to
      basically all areas of life

** What is politics?
 #+BEAMER: \pause 
 - Conflict and struggles over the leadership, structure, and policies
   of government

* The Founding 

** Why break from Britain? 
- Britain left the colonies alone for a while
- But then needed help to pay for a costly war
- Raised taxes on colonies, as they defended the colonies during the war
- This did not go over well 

** The Declaration of Independence 
- For the time (1776), a somewhat radical document
- "Unalienable rights"
  - Life
  - Liberty
  - The pursuit of happiness
- Is it just to revolt against your government?
#+BEAMER: \pause
  - Yes, when said government does not respect these rights 
- Laundry list of complaints

** The Declaration of Independence 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in
General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the
world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by
Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and
declare, That these united Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free
and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to
the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and
the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; 
#+END_QUOTE
** The Declaration of Independence 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy
War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do
all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do.
And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the
protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our
Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.
#+END_QUOTE
** The Revolutionary War
- British military forces vastly outnumbered the colonists
- British economy much greater than the colonies
- Royalists in the colonies weren't in favor of independence
- Ultimately, the war was too expensive for Britain
- Independence granted in the Treaty of Paris (1783)
** The Articles of Confederation 
- First pass at a governing document
- Ultimately failed because the central government was too weak
  - Examples: 
  - No ability to tax
  - No executive
  - No standing army
** Constitutional Convention (1787)
- Called to amend the Articles of Confederation
- Every state (except Rhode Island) sent delegates 
- Quickly became apparent that the Articles needed to be scrapped and
  rewritten

** Constitutional Convention (1787)
