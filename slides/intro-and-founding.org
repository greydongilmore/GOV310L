** What is government?
 #+BEAMER: \pause
 - The institutions and procedures through which a land and its people
   are ruled
 - These can be simple or complex

** Why government?
 - We're all farmers and one of us proposes to build an irrigation
   system. How do we decide what happens? Does it get built? Who pays
   for it? Who maintains it? 
 - Tragedy of the commons

** Functions of government
#+BEAMER: \pause
 - Maintain order
 - Protect property
 - Provide public goods
** The basic power of government
 Coercion!

** Who rules?
 - Autocracy :: rule by a single individual
 - Oligarchy :: rule by a small class of people (landowners, military
      officers, etc)
 - Democracy :: system that allows citizens to play a significant role
      in the governmental process, usually through selection of
      officials

** How do they govern?
 - Constitutional :: Formal and effective limits placed on government
 - Authoritarian :: No formal limits, but may be checked by other
      social forces (the church, for example)
 - Totalitarian :: No formal limits and the state seeks to expand to
      basically all areas of life

** What is politics?
 #+BEAMER: \pause 
 - Conflict and struggles over the leadership, structure, and policies
   of government
