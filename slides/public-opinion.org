* What is public opinion?
** Why is it important? 
- Constrains political actors (the President, Congress, the Courts)
- Standard by which we judge how democracy is functioning
  - Does policy reflect what people want?
** What is public opinion? 
- Individual people have opinions
- We refer to the aggregation of individuals' opinions as *public opinion*
- Many different methods for this aggregation:
  - For example, elections, town hall meetings, protests, polls
** Individual political opinion
- Individuals' political opinions depend on three things:
- Basic *preferences* (what they want)
- *Beliefs* about the current circumstances and consequences of actions
- *Choices* presented
** Preferences
- Preferences reflect what people want
  - Material: money, power, income 
  - Values: justice, morality
- Economic self-interest and social/moral values often taken as the
  basis for political preferences
- Preference /intensity/ also important
  - Do you care more about LGBT rights or tax rates?
** Beliefs 
- What people know (or think they know)
- What they believe the consequences of their actions will be
- Individuals who spend more time on a subject generally have stronger
  beliefs
- Beliefs don't have to be based in fact - can be grounded in (e.g.)
  political ideology or religion
** Choices 
- We never observe preferences or beliefs, only choices
- In an election, the choices are the candidates
- In a public opinion survey, these are the answer choices
- Adding (or deleting) choices may change individuals' responses
** Choices (continued)
- Some issues that people care about may not be presented
- For example, the Democratic party kept race off the agenda for a
  long time to keep Southern Democrats in the party
- These are referred to as *latent* issues
* Variety of opinion 
** Public opinion is varied
- Politicians often say that "public opinion" is on their side
- But public opinion is varied - all Americans don't hold the same
  opinion
- We agree on some of the basics:
  - legitimacy of the Constitution, equality of opportunity, liberty,
    democracy
- But most issues the government deals with are areas where the public
  doesn't hold a single view
** Expression of public opinion
- Individuals express opinion in a variety of ways
  - Contacting member of Congress (letters, phone calls, etc)
  - Blogs, letters to newspapers, conversations with peers
  - Lawn signs, bumper stickers
  - Volunteering for campaigns, giving money to candidates
  - Voting
- Not always easy to interpret
** Interpretation of public opinion
- If someone votes against their Representative, why did they do so?
  - A decision the Representative made?
  - Party?
  - Something else?
- Where does majority support lie? How intense is that support?
** Interpretation of public opinion, continued
- Often helpful to think about as support/oppose a policy
- But this can mask important variation
- Example:
  - Abortion pro-life vs pro-choice
  - But people have more refined opinions (in cases of rape, incest,
    parental consent, endangering the life of the mother, etc)
** Examples of opinions
- Evaluations of actors and institutions
  - presidential approval, congressional approval, etc
- Assessments of public policies
  - Support or oppose a policy, most important problem, etc
- Assessments of current circumstances
  - How is the economy performing? How's your personal outlook?
- Political orientations
  - Party ID and ideology

** Polarization 
- Recall from the first half of the semester that elites seem to be
  highly polarized
- Pundits and journalists oftentimes suggest that the public is highly
  polarized as well
- However, political science suggests that the public, /unlike
  political elites/, is not highly polarized.
- Why is that the case?

* Origins and Nature of Public Opinion

** Foundations of Preferences 
- Self-interest
- Values
- Social groups

** Foundations - Self-Interest 
- Economic
  - Taxes, for example
- Regulations
  - Clean air, property rights, etc
- Labor
  - About 19 million people work for federal, state, or local government
  - This is about 12% of the labor force
  - Another million are in the armed forces
  - Federal government expenditures account for about 20% of GDP
- Zoning laws, urban development, family laws, etc

** Foundations - values
- What is right and wrong?
- Our /value systems/ help determine what we want government to do
- We develop value systems from many different places - family,
  religion, school, social groups, etc
- Economic justice
  - Equality of opportunity
- Criminal justice 
  - What's a crime and what is an appropriate punishment
- What's marriage?
  - Economic arrangement, interracial marriage, gay marriage 

** Equal wealth 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Some people think that the government in Washington ought 
to reduce the income differences between the rich and the poor, 
perhaps by raising the taxes of wealthy families or by giving 
income assistance to the poor. Others think that the government 
should not concern itself with reducing this income difference 
between the rich and the poor. Here is a card with a scale from 
1 to 7. Think of a score of 1 as meaning that the government 
ought to reduce the income differences between rich and poor, 
and a score of 7 meaning that the government should not concern 
itself with reducing income differences. What score between 1 
and 7 comes closest to the way you feel?

#+ATTR_LATEX: :float t
#+RESULTS:
[[file:../figures/equalwealth-2014-gss.pdf]]

** Foundations - social groups
- The people we interact with - family, neighbors, race, religion, etc
- People tend to support policies that benefit the group they belong
  to
  - And thus, indirectly, themselves
- People can change opinions simply by joining an organization
  - People can internalize the collective value
  - For example, when our company does well we feel good
- *Socialization* is the process through which individuals assimilate
  collective preferences and norms through social interactions
  - This usually occurs relatively early in life (before 18), but
    continues at a slower pace throughout life

** Political ideology 
- Politics and political decisions are very complicated
- Ideology is a simplification of the political world
- In the US, we use *liberal* and *conservative* to describe
  individuals' ideologies
- Generally, liberals support political and social reform; government
  intervention in the economy; the expansion of federal social
  services; more vigorous efforts on behalf of the poor, minorities,
  and women; and greater concern for consumers and the environment
- Generally, conservatives support the social and economic status quo,
  favor markets as solutions to social problems, and believe that
  large and powerful government pose a threat to citizens' freedoms

** Ideology (continued)
- Oftentimes we think of ideology as a spectrum with those on the left
  favoring more liberal policies and those on the right favoring more
  conservative ones
- In general, the Democrats represent more liberal views and the
  Republicans more conservative

** Ideology (2014 GSS)
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float t
[[file:../figures/ideology-2014-gss.pdf]]

** Identity Politics
- Just as ideology helps us simplify the political world, identity can
  play the same role
- People identify with certain groups because of shared social
  connections or values and interests
- Harms/benefits to one member of that group are harms/benefits for
  all members
- These groups can be broad
  - For example, most consider themselves "American" and root for the
    US during the World Cup
- Political party
  - Usually stable, attachment developed in childhood and carried
    throughout life
  - The best predictor of how people will vote, even after taking into
    account self-interest, economics, and other identities
- Oftentimes identity politics refers to historically underrepresented
  groups

** Identity politics - Blacks
- Slavery created a large divide between whites and blacks in our society
- This manifests in many different ways
- For example, among whites income and conservatism are positively
  correlated (as income goes up, whites tend to be more conservative)
- But among black people, this correlation does not exist
- Nearly all black people support the Democratic party

** Identity politics - Hispanics 
- Tend to prioritize different issues from non-Hispanics
- Education, immigration instead of the economy
- More heterogeneity among Hispanics than Blacks due to different
  communities (Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, etc)
- Hispanics tend to be Democrats, though not to the extent that black
  people are

** Identity politics - sex
- Men and women express different opinions as well
- These can be easy to understand why:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Now I'm going to read several more statements. As I read 
each one, please tell me whether you strongly agree, agree, 
disagree, or strongly disagree with it. d. It is much better for 
everyone involved if the man is the achiever outside the home 
and the woman takes care of the home and family.

** Identity politics - sex
- Or they can be more difficult to understand why women and men have
  different views:

    reducing income differences 

** Identity politics - sex

[[file:../figures/female-equalwealth-2014-gss.pdf]]

** Identity politics - sex
- Overall, women tend to be less supportive of militaristic policies,
  more likely to favor environmental protections, and more supportive
  of government-run social and health care programs
- Unsurprisingly, then, women tend to support the Democratic party
- This difference is relatively small - usually between 5 and 10
  percentage points

** Identity politics - religion
- Perhaps not as strong in the US as in other countries
- But people are more likely to vote for candidates who share their religion
  - Catholics for Kennedy
  - Born-again Christians for Carter
  - Mormons for Romney
- Catholics more likely to be Democrats

** Identity politics - geography 
- We already talked about one geographic group - Americans
- There are other clear divisions - North versus South
- Urban versus rural
  - Urban areas heavily Democrat, rural areas heavily Republican
- Even neighborhoods that we live in or come from

* Public Opinion and Political Knowledge

** Political knowledge & preference stability
- The average American knows little about current events or basic
  facts of American government
- However, they can express (relatively) clear preferences across a
  broad range of issues
- The reason for this general ignorance is clear:
- It is costly (time, etc) to learn about politics, especially when
  there's little to no benefit in doing so

** Shortcuts
- Since becoming knowledgeable about politics requires a lot of time
  and energy, most people rely on shortcuts, labels, and stereotypes
- One such shortcut is relying on others' judgment
  - Ministers, TV personalities, politicians, etc
- Another is to view policy proposals through the lens of ideology

** Dangers of political inattentiveness 
- Some argue that low levels of political knowledge harm democracy
- Those with low political knowledge may not understand where their
  interests are
- People with low levels of political knowledge are easier to
  manipulate

** Stability
- Although political knowledge for any one individual is low, public
  opinion in the aggregate is quite stable
- Most people retain one partisanship throughout life
- Individuals' values remain basically stable

** Stability and aggregation
- One of democracy's great strengths lies in the aggregation of
  numbers
- Aggregation counteracts the effects of political ignorance
((Examples))

** Static?
- Aggregate stability does not mean that opinion never changes
- 1945 - 1970 civil rights
- 1960s - 1970s taxation 
- 1990 - now gay rights

* Shaping Opinion 

** Actors
- MANY different actors try to convince people to their side.
  - Government
  - Private groups
  - Media

** Government and shaping opinion 
- Government tries to convince citizens to think or act certain ways
- Support for policies (wars, health campaigns, etc)
- Oftentimes not successful
- Polls, social media, TV, etc

** Private groups and shaping opinion 
- Interest groups try to sway public opinion to their side
- US Chamber of Commerce, Heritage Foundation, Hoover Institution
- AFL-CIO, Sierra Club, etc

** The media and opinion 
- The media play a large role in public opinion formation
- Most Americans say that their primary source of information about
  politics is from the media - newspapers, cable and broadcast TV,
  radio, internet sites
- The media is the conduit through which information flows

** Media (continued)
- Media act as an *agenda setter*
  - Has the power to bring attention (or not) to particular issues and
    problems
- The media can also *prime* people by making them think about an
  issue in a certain context
  - For example, covering 
- Finally, the media can *frame* issues in a certain way
  - For example, covering waste in the welfare system primes people to
    think about it in terms of governmental inefficiency

** Media (continued)
- Priming can distract people from important problems
- Framing can make us think about issues in a biased way
- These /usually/ aren't a problem because competing sides are trying
  to prime/frame issues in opposing ways, resulting in information
  flowing freely 
** Trump's media coverage

* Measuring Public Opinion
** Constructing opinion from surveys 
- By and large, *public opinion polls* are the most widely-used method
  of gauging public opinion
- These rely on choosing a *sample* from the *population* we're
  interested in studying
  - The population here is oftentimes all Americans (or at least those
    over 18)
- The sample needs to accurately reflect the population
** Dewey defeats Truman!
** Techniques and selection bias
- Probability sampling is great if you know the entire population
- But this usually isn't the case with voters
- So we use *random-digit dialing* instead
- *Selection bias* can skew the results of a poll
  - This happens when we make an error where our sample is not
    representative of the population we're trying to learn about
** Sample Size
- The more people you survey, the more accurate you can be
- *Sampling error* or *margin of error* is polling error that arises
  from the size of the sample
** Survey design 
- The way that we ask questions influences the way people answer
- Consider welfare. Do we ask about welfare or assistance to the poor?
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Do you think we're spending too much, too little, or about the right
amount on (welfare) or (assistance to the poor)?
