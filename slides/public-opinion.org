* What is public opinion?
** Why is it important? 
- Constrains political actors (the President, Congress, the Courts)
- Standard by which we judge how democracy is functioning
  - Does policy reflect what people want?
** What is public opinion? 
- Individual people have opinions
- We refer to the aggregation of individuals' opinions as *public opinion*
- Many different methods for this aggregation:
  - For example, elections, town hall meetings, protests, polls
** Individual political opinion
- Individuals' political opinions depend on three things:
- Basic *preferences* (what they want)
- *Beliefs* about the current circumstances and consequences of actions
- *Choices* presented
** Preferences
- Preferences reflect what people want
  - Material: money, power, income 
  - Values: justice, morality
- Economic self-interest and social/moral values often taken as the
  basis for political preferences
- Preference /intensity/ also important
  - Do you care more about LGBT rights or tax rates?
** Beliefs 
- What people know (or think they know)
- What they believe the consequences of their actions will be
- Individuals who spend more time on a subject generally have stronger
  beliefs
- Beliefs don't have to be based in fact - can be grounded in (e.g.)
  political ideology or religion
** Choices 
- We never observe preferences or beliefs, only choices
- In an election, the choices are the candidates
- In a public opinion survey, these are the answer choices
- Adding (or deleting) choices may change individuals' responses
** Choices (continued)
- Some issues that people care about may not be presented
- For example, the Democratic party kept race off the agenda for a
  long time to keep Southern Democrats in the party
- These are referred to as *latent* issues
* Variety of opinion 
** Public opinion is varied
- Politicians often say that "public opinion" is on their side
- But public opinion is varied - all Americans don't hold the same
  opinion
- We agree on some of the basics:
  - legitimacy of the Constitution, equality of opportunity, liberty,
    democracy
- But most issues the government deals with are areas where the public
  doesn't hold a single view
** Expression of public opinion
- Individuals express opinion in a variety of ways
  - Contacting member of Congress (letters, phone calls, etc)
  - Blogs, letters to newspapers, conversations with peers
  - Lawn signs, bumper stickers
  - Volunteering for campaigns, giving money to candidates
  - Voting
- Not always easy to interpret
** Interpretation of public opinion
- If someone votes against their Representative, why did they do so?
  - A decision the Representative made?
  - Party?
  - Something else?
- Where does majority support lie? How intense is that support?
** Interpretation of public opinion, continued
- Often helpful to think about as support/oppose a policy
- But this can mask important variation
- Example:
  - Abortion pro-life vs pro-choice
  - But people have more refined opinions (in cases of rape, incest,
    parental consent, endangering the life of the mother, etc)
** Examples of opinions
- Evaluations of actors and institutions
  - presidential approval, congressional approval, etc
- Assessments of public policies
  - Support or oppose a policy, most important problem, etc
- Assessments of current circumstances
  - How is the economy performing? How's your personal outlook?
- Political orientations
  - Party ID and ideology

** Equal wealth 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Some people think that the government in Washington ought 
to reduce the income differences between the rich and the poor, 
perhaps by raising the taxes of wealthy families or by giving 
income assistance to the poor. Others think that the government 
should not concern itself with reducing this income difference 
between the rich and the poor. Here is a card with a scale from 
1 to 7. Think of a score of 1 as meaning that the government 
ought to reduce the income differences between rich and poor, 
and a score of 7 meaning that the government should not concern 
itself with reducing income differences. What score between 1 
and 7 comes closest to the way you feel?
