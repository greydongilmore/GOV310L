* Nominating candidates, quick history 
** National Conventions
- Usually national conventions controlled the nominations
- Neither democratic nor transparent
- Party bosses played a large role
- "Smoke-filled rooms"
** The Progressives
- Progressives in the 1920s pushed for more open government (generally)
- Part of this was opening the nomination process
- Some states opted in, but the primary didn't gain much momentum
** Rise of the primary
- Primaries became more important throughout the 1970s - 1980s
  - Especially after disastrous 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago
- Today the primary system is the most important path to the
  nomination
** Strengths of the primary system
- More democratic
  - Voter turnout usually around 20% (in earlier states)
- Greater choice of candidates
- Allows outsiders a chance
- Campaign experience
** Weaknesses of the primary system
- Voter apathy
- Weird voters
  - Highly ideological
- Very long
- Very expensive
- Dominated by the media
- Lack of party vetting 

* The Path to the Nomination - today
** Timeline
- Invisible primary (? - ?, January?)
  - Oftentimes at least a year before official campaigning 
- Primaries and caucuses (January - June)
- National conventions (July/August)
  - "Selection" of presidential nominee
  - VP nominee
  - Party platform 
- Election campaign (July/August - November)
  - Technically Election Day is the first Tuesday after the first
    Monday in November 
* The Invisible Primary
** The Invisible Primary
- When? - before January
- Purposes
  - Fund raising
  - Alliance building
  - Party support
- Polling to determine popularity
- Press!
* Primaries & Caucuses 
** Timeline
- Iowa and New Hampshire go first (in that order)
- Usually in mid-January
- A few states in February or early March (Nevada, South Carolina)
- Super Tuesday
  - One or more Tuesdays in which many states have a primary/caucus
- Timing is super important

Vote total includes only votes case for one of those three candidates  

** The next primaries
- March 5: Kansas, Kentucky (R), Louisiana, Maine (R), Nebraska (D)
- March 6: Maine (D), Puerto Rico (R),
- March 8: Hawaii (R), Idaho (R), Michigan, Mississippi
- March 12: DC (R), North Mariana Islands (D)
- March 15: Florida[fn:1], Illinois, Missouri, North Mariana
  Islands[fn:2], North Carolina, Ohio[fn:3]
- March 19: Virgin Islands (R)

* Characteristics of primaries
** Primary vs caucus
- Primary more like an election
- Caucus more "town hall" style
  - Listen to speeches by supporters of each candidate
- Caucus asks more of people (time)
- Some people prefer caucuses because of the deliberative aspect
- Texas uses a primary 
** Who can vote?
- Closed
  - Only registered partisans can vote (and only in their party's primary)
- Open
  - Texas is open
  - All registered voters can vote in either party's primary
- Mixed or Hybrid 
  - Varies, but usually lets independents vote in either primary contest
- Blanket
  - Not used for presidential primaries
  - First election all candidates listed together (all parties)
  - If one candidate secures 50% or more of the vote, they're elected
  - Otherwise, have a runoff election between the top two votegetters 
** How are delegates awarded?
- Winner-take-all
  - Plurality winner takes all of a state's delegates
- Proportional
  - Candidates receive delegates proportional to their share of the vote
  - Can include thresholds (e.g. must get above x% of the vote)
  - Can include winner-take-all triggers (e.g. if a candidate gets
    more than x% of the statewide vote, they get all the candidates)
** Delegate allocation
- Democrats use proportional system almost exclusively 
- Republicans use a more complicated system
  - Proportional before March 15th (mostly...), allows winner take
      all after that
** Texas delegate allocation
- Democrats - Basically proportional. [[http://www.txdemocrats.org/2016DraftDelegateSelectionPlan.pdf][Here's]] a 39 page document that
  describes the full process 
- Republicans: Proportional, 20% threshold – If a candidate wins more
  than 50% of the statewide vote, he or she is awarded all of the
  state's at-large delegates. If a candidate wins more than 50% of the
  vote in a district, he or she is awarded all of the district's
  delegates.
** What are these "super" delegates!?! 
- Democrats have "super" delegates
- Not bound to any particular candidate
- Can state their intention to vote for someone...
- But that can change (2008)
- Instituted after several disastrous nominees
- Way for the party to weight the nomination process against/for
  certain candidates
* The National Conventions
** Timing
- Usually the out party holds their convention in July and the
  incumbent party in August
- In 2016, both are in July (because of the Olympics)
** Hosts
- Conventions are large, so cities compete to host them
- Parties may also be strategic about where they are held
  - For example, to get more votes in a battleground state
- In 2016, Republicans are in Cleveland and Democrats are in
  Philadelphia
** Purposes - Platform
- The party *platform* contains its goals and proposals (/planks/)
- Usually pretty generic language appealing to traditional party
  supporters
- Ideological, /not/ specific policy proposals
** Purposes - "Selection" of nominees
- Voting occurs to select the party's nominee for president
- This is usually a foregone conclusion since candidates can
  mathematically secure the nomination several months prior
- Possible to have a *brokered convention* where no candidate secured
  a majority of delegates
  - These are few and far between, party rules for delegate selection
    make this unlikely
** Purposes - Speeches and media coverage
- Major purpose of the convention is media coverage
- Many speeches given by former party leaders (e.g. past presidents,
  past senators, etc), current party leaders, highly-regarded
  citizens, nominees
- Free media coverage
- Acts as the official start of the campaign season in many ways
- Unlike many campaign events, conventions can actually affect the
  outcome of the election
# * The Campaign
# * The Election
# ** Election Day
# - Election day is the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November
# - In 2016, that makes it November 8th
# - What it takes to win:
#   - 270 electoral votes
# ** What is an electoral vote?
# - The founders liked democracy but were afraid of too much democracy
# - The Electoral College is one way the devised to dilute the passions
#   of the masses
# - In November, we elect Electors to the Electoral College
# - These Electors then gather later on and elect the new President
# ** The Electoral College
# - Each state gets as many Electors as it has representatives in Congress
#   - So the minimum is three (1 Representative + 2 Senators)
#   - California has the most (55 as of 2016)
#   - DC also gets three
# - Need an absolute majority to win (270 of 538)
# - States (with the exception of Nebraska and Maine) give /all/ of
#   their electoral votes to the candidate with the most votes in their state
# - So if Candidate X gets 49% of the vote and Candidate Y gets 51% of
#   the vote, Candidate Y receives 100% of the state's electoral votes
# ** The Electoral College, continued 
# - Because of the winner-take-all allocation rules of most states, this
#   makes campaigning in some states /much/ more important than others
# - Why?
# ** The Electoral College, continued
# - Consider Texas - do the Democrats have a chance of receiving Texas's
#   38 electoral votes in 2016?
# - Do the Republicans have a chance of getting California's 55?

# ** The Electoral College, continued 
# - Some states closer than others
#   - These states considered *battleground* states
#   - Which states are considered battleground states varies a bit from
#     year to year 
# ** Advantages of the Electoral College
# ** Disadvantages of the Electoral College
# ** Proposals to reform Electoral College
