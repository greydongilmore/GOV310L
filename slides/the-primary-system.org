* Nominating candidates, quick history 
** National Conventions
- Usually national conventions controlled the nominations
- Neither democratic nor transparent
- Party bosses played a large role
- "Smoke-filled rooms"
** The Progressives
- Progressives in the 1920s pushed for more open government (generally)
- Part of this was opening the nomination process
- Some states opted in, but the primary didn't gain much momentum
** Rise of the primary
- Primaries became more important throughout the 1970s - 1980s
  - Especially after disastrous 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago
- Today the primary system is the most important path to the
  nomination
** Strengths of the primary system
- More democratic
  - Voter turnout usually around 20% (in earlier states)
- Greater choice of candidates
- Allows outsiders a chance
- Campaign experience
** Weaknesses of the primary system
- Voter apathy
- Weird voters
  - Highly ideological
- Very long
- Very expensive
- Dominated by the media
- Lack of party vetting 

* The Path to the Nomination - today
** Timeline
- Invisible primary (? - ?, January?)
  - Oftentimes at least a year before official campaigning 
- Primaries and caucuses (January - June)
- National conventions (July/August)
  - "Selection" of presidential nominee
  - VP nominee
  - Party platform 
- Election campaign (July/August - November)
  - Technically Election Day is the first Tuesday after the first
    Monday in November 
* The Invisible Primary
** The Invisible Primary
- When? - before January
- Purposes
  - Fund raising
  - Alliance building
  - Party support
- Polling to determine popularity
- Press!
* Primaries & Caucuses 
** Timeline
- Iowa and New Hampshire go first (in that order)
- Usually in mid-January
- A few states in February or early March (Nevada, South Carolina)
- Super Tuesday
  - One or more Tuesdays in which many states have a primary/caucus
- Timing is super important

* Characteristics of primaries
** Primary vs caucus
- Primary more like an election
- Caucus more "town hall" style
  - Listen to speeches by supporters of each candidate
- Caucus asks more of people (time)
- Some people prefer caucuses because of the deliberative aspect
- Texas uses a primary 
** Who can vote?
- Closed
  - Only registered partisans can vote (and only in their party's primary)
- Open
  - Texas is open
  - All registered voters can vote in either party's primary
- Mixed
  - Varies, but usually lets independents vote in either primary contest
- Blanket
  - Not used for presidential primaries
  - First election all candidates listed together (all parties)
  - If one candidate secures 50% or more of the vote, they're elected
  - Otherwise, have a runoff election between the top two votegetters 
** How are delegates awarded?
- Winner-take-all
- Proportional
  - Democrats use this almost exclusively
  - Based on statewide vote and congressional districts
  - Republicans use a more complicated system
** Texas delegate allocation
- Democrats - Basically proportional. [[http://www.txdemocrats.org/2016DraftDelegateSelectionPlan.pdf][Here's]] a 39 page document that
  describes the full process 
- Republicans: Proportional, 20% threshold – If a candidate wins more
  than 50% of the statewide vote, he or she is awarded all of the
  state's at-large delegates. If a candidate wins more than 50% of the
  vote in a district, he or she is awarded all of the district's
  delegates.
** What are these "super" delegates!?! 
- Democrats have "super" delegates
- Not bound to any particular candidate
- Can state their intention to vote for someone...
- But that can change (2008)
- Instituted after several disastrous nominees
- Way for the party to weight the nomination process against/for
  certain candidates
