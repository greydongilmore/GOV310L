* Nominating candidates, quick history 
** National Conventions
- Usually national conventions controlled the nominations
- Neither democratic nor transparent
- Party bosses played a large role
- "Smoke-filled rooms"
** The Progressives
- Progressives in the 1920s pushed for more open government (generally)
- Part of this was opening the nomination process
- Some states opted in, but the primary didn't gain much momentum
** Rise of the primary
- Primaries became more important throughout the 1970s - 1980s
  - Especially after disastrous 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago
- Today the primary system is the most important path to the
  nomination
** Strengths of the primary system
- More democratic
  - Voter turnout usually around 20% (in earlier states)
- Greater choice of candidates
- Allows outsiders a chance
- Campaign experience
** Weaknesses of the primary system
- Voter apathy
- Weird voters
  - Highly ideological
- Very long
- Very expensive
- Dominated by the media
- Lack of party vetting 

* The Path to the Nomination - today
** Timeline
- Invisible primary (? - ?, January?)
  - Oftentimes at least a year before official campaigning 
- Primaries and caucuses (January - June)
- National conventions (July/August)
  - "Selection" of presidential nominee
  - VP nominee
  - Party platform 
- Election campaign (July/August - November)
  - Technically Election Day is the first Tuesday after the first
    Monday in November 
* The Invisible Primary
** The Invisible Primary
- When? - before January
- Purposes
  - Fund raising
  - Alliance building
  - Party support
- Polling to determine popularity
- Press!
* Primaries & Caucuses 
** Timeline
- Iowa and New Hampshire go first (in that order)
- Usually in mid-January
- A few states in February or early March (Nevada, South Carolina)
- Super Tuesday
  - One or more Tuesdays in which many states have a primary/caucus
  - In 2016, March 1st and about $\frac{1}{2}$ of Republican delegates
    are at stake, and about $\frac{1}{3}$ of Democratic delegates
- Timing is super important
