* Federalism

** Who does what?
- Federalism  :: system of government that divides power between a
     central government and regional governments
- Sovereignty :: supreme and independent political authority

** National government
- Expressed powers :: given directly in Constitution
- Implied powers :: necessary and proper clause
- Supremacy clause :: national laws trump state laws

** State governments
- Reserved powers :: tenth amendment reserves powers not specified in
     the Constitution to the states
- Police power :: power to regulate health, safety, welfare, and
     morals of citizens
- Concurrent powers :: power possessed by both the state and national
     government (e.g. taxation)

** Obligations of states to each other
- Full faith and credit clause
  - States must honor other states' laws
- Privileges and immunities 
  - No special treatment of residents
- Extradition

* Evolution of Federalism in the US

** Dual federalism 
- Up through the 1930s
- Fundamental government powers shared by national and state governments
- State governments more important

** Dual federalism
- Necessary and proper clause interpreted widely in /McCulloch v.
  Maryland/
- Interstate commerce clause in /Gibbons v. Ogden/
- Both granted much power to national government
- Little growth of the national government up through 1930s
- Judiciary dominated by states rights interpretations post Marshall

** The New Deal
- FDR elected in 1932
- New Deal: greatly expanded scope and power of national government
- FDIC, TVA, SEC, FHA, NLRB, social security, etc

** Cooperative federalism 
- Post 1930s through 1960s
- Federal government uses subsidies to encourage states to pursue
  federal goals
- Subsidies called grants-in-aid

** Dual vs cooperative federalism
- Layer cake - marble cake
- Federal aid to states makes up roughly 30-35% of states budgets

** Regulated federalism
- 1960s to present
- More active federal government
- Threaten to withhold funding if states don't conform to national
  standards
  - E.g. American with disabilities act
- Unfunded mandates
- Conditional grants, block grants
* Separation of Powers
