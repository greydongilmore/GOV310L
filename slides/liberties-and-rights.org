*Civil Rights*
- Who may participate in collective decision making process
- How government must (or cannot) treat its citizens

* Civil Liberties
** Who decides? 
- The courts are the major actor
  - Jurisdiction from Article II, statues, and prior decisions (precedent)
- Congress also plays a role
  - Constitutional amendments, lawmaking
- The president to a lesser extent 

** The Bill of Rights
- Confusingly, the bill of rights focuses on what government must /not/ do and thus is concerned with civil liberties
- Not originally included in Constitution because Hamilton & others thought it irrelevant

** The Bill of Rights
- Originally applied only to the federal government (dual citizenship)
- The 14th amendment (post Civil War) provides for a single national citizenship, but the Court doesn't start to expand protections provided by the Bill of Rights to the states until late 1800s, but especially the 1930s & 60s

** The First Amendment
- *Establishment Clause* prevents Congress from making a law respecting the establishment of religion
- What does that mean?
