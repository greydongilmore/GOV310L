* What are interest groups

** What are interest groups?
Evil corporate groups who exploit the democratic system...

** What are interest groups?
Or a varied system of organizations who represent the interests of
their members?

** Interest groups and democracy
- Education of members on issues that affect them
- Lobbying on behalf of members
- Promote democratic participation (voting, etc) 

** The evil of faction
- Founders concern with faction
- /Especially/ a majority

** Pluralism
- *Pluralism* - interests should be free to compete for influence over government
- This will (hopefully) produce desired outcomes
- Interests groups not equal in resources, though 

** (Economic?) interests 
- Many (most?) interest groups represent economic interests
  - Corporate: Chamber of Commerce, Microsoft, etc
  - Labor: AFL-CIO, Teamsters
  - Professional organizations: The Bar Association, the American
    Medical Association

** Groups' lifelines: Members
- Membership essential
  - Collective action problems (and solutions)

** Groups' lifelines: Money
- Groups usually rely on membership dues
- As well as voluntary contributions

** Groups' lifelines: Leaders 
- Leadership and organization essential
- Can be simple
- Or complicated - melding local chapters into states, then states
  into national...

** Membership
- Many more upper-class citizens belong to interest groups than
  lower-class citizens
  - Wealthier people tend to have more money and time
  - These groups can also provide professional contacts for their careers

** Membership
- Even groups associated with progressive politics and support for the
  poor tend to have upper-middle and upper-class members

* How and Why?

** Interest groups
- Interest groups don't represent interests in proportion to the
  interest in the population
- In the 1980s, 7% of adults were in managerial/administrative roles,
  but 71% of interests groups represented them
  - Or, 4% of the population looking for work but only 0.1% of
    organizations 

** Facilitation of cooperation 
- Interest groups join to facilitate cooperation between their members
- All members better off if they achieve some shared goal
- But it's costly to obtain that goal...

** Prisoner's dilemma 
- You and your friend are accused of stealing & are kept in separate rooms
- The police need one of you to rat the other in order to build their
  case
#+BEAMER: \pause 
|              | Snitch | Don't snitch |
|--------------+--------+--------------|
| /            | <      |              |
| Snitch       | (3,3)  | (0,6)        |
| Don't snitch | (6,0)  | (1,1)        |

** What's the best choice?
#+BEAMER: \pause
- If we're A, then we're always better off snitching
  - If B also snitches, we get 3 instead of 6 years
  - If B doesn't, then we go free instead of getting 1 year
- So both end up snitching on each other, getting (3,3) instead of (1,1)

** The logic of collective action 
- The *free-rider problem* is pervasive in interest group formation
- Large groups tend to be anonymous
- Difficult to argue that any one person's actions will make a difference
- Enforcement
- Thus, it's hard for large groups to form

** Collective action problem solutions 
- *Selective benefits* - benefits of joining a group that are only
  available to its members
- Informational: Conferences, research
- Material: insurance, discounts
- Solidarity: networking, friendship
- Purposive: advocacy & participation

* (How) do interest groups influence policy?

** Insider and outsider strategies
- Insider strategies involve directly working with politicians and
  their staff
- Outsider strategies involve going public and using electoral tactics
- Many groups use both of these

** Lobbying 
- *Lobbying* is attempting to influence the policy process through
  persuasion of government officials
- Lobbyists have to register with the government & disclose what they
  lobby on
- Approximately $4 billion per year is spent on lobbying at the
  federal and state level

** Lobbying members of Congress 
- Lobbyists provide information to Congresspeople
- Testify on behalf of clients at hearings
- Direct members' campaign contributions

** lobbying the president
- Lobbying Congress is hard
- Lobbying the President is harder
- Very limited time

** Lobbying the executive branch 
- Continue to lobby after laws passed
- Comment period on new rules is frequently used by lobbyists

** Lobbying regulation 
- Many regulations on what lobbyists must (not) do:
  - Business can't deduct lobbying costs from taxes
  - Associations must report percent of membership dues that goes to lobbying
  - Registration of lobbyists

** Lobbying regulation
- Limitation of gifts to Congresspeople:
  - $50, no more than $100 annually

** Using the courts
- Bringing suit directly
- Financing suits brought by individuals
- Filing /amicus curiae/ briefs

** Using the courts
- Increasingly, the courts are a battleground where various interests fight
- E.g. the privacy and abortion fights, segregation, etc

** Mobilizing public opinion
- *Going public* - launching a campaign to raise awareness of your
  issue and persuade people

** Advertising
- TV, newspapers, radio, etc
- Both image-building
- And persuasive

** Grassroots lobbying
- Direct mail & email
- Increasingly prevalent

** Protest
- Raises public recognition for protestors
- Can be disruptive to commerce & traffic, forcing negotiation with protestors
- Strikes and general strikes are some of union's most powerful
  weapons

** Electoral politics - PACS
- *PACs* - Political action committees
- Separate and segregated from campaigns 
- Typically focus on House races
- Little evidence that PAC contributions "buy" votes from those members

** Electoral politics - Independent expenditures
- Independent expenditure committees - *Super PACs*
- Allowed after 2010 /Citizens United/ case 
- May raise unlimited amounts of money from any source
  - must report donors
  - may not directly coordinate

** Electoral politics - campaign activism 
- Get out the vote campaigns
- Can have large effects in low-turnout elections

** Electoral politics - the initiative
- The *initiative* allows citizens to pass policy without going
  through the legislature
- Interest groups can run campaigns to get the requisite number of
  signatures

** Are interest groups effective? 
- Lots of research shows that lobbying and such has little or no effect
- If it is effective, why don't we see much more?
