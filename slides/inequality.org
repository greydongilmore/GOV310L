** Inequality
- Welcome to the week on inequality
- Or, "life isn't fair"

* Racial Inequality

** History
- Divisions and inequalities across racial groups has been (and
  continues to be) one of the largest sources of inequality in
  American politics 

** History --- Blacks
- Slavery and racism in the US has had a long and lasting impact on
  the socioeconomic status of black people
- Major events:
  - 1787: Three-fifths compromise
  - 1861--1865: Civil War
  - 1863--1877: Reconstruction
  - 1960s: Civil Rights Movement

** Perception of bias
- Black are (unsurprisingly) more likely to say that systematic bias
  exists in our socioeconomic system.
#+BEAMER: \pause 
- For example (2014 General Social Survey): 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
On the average African-Americans have worse jobs, income, and housing
than white people. Do you think these differences are mainly due
to discrimination?
#+END_QUOTE

** Perception of bias

** Today 
The average black person is less well-off than the average white person

|       | Median HH income | Unemployment rate | Poverty rate |
|-------+------------------+-------------------+--------------|
| Black | $35,416          |             11.4% |        27.2% |
| White | $59,754          |              5.3% |         9.7% |

** Education 
- Blacks and Hispanics on average receive lower grades, are more
  likely to drop out, score lower on standardized tests, are less
  likely to enter college, and are less likely to complete college

** Crime
Evidence that much of the criminal justice system is systematically
biased against racial minorities

#+BEAMER: \pause

Example: whites and blacks use drugs at comparable rates[fn:1]

** Drug related arrest rates

** Representation 
- Historically blacks and Hispanics have not gotten much
  representation in Congress
- First black person elected to Congress in 1870

** Congress today
- The current Congress (114th) is the most diverse to date
- 17% of this Congress is non-white
  - 20% of House, but only 6% of Senate  
  - However, 38% of the US population is non-white

** Congress today
- 35% of black people in the population are represented by a black
  House member[fn:2]
- 22% of Hispanics, 12% of Asians, 8% of Native Americans 

** Black representation in 2016

** Example: Names

* Gender Inequality

** Pay gap 

** In representation 

* Inequalities based on sexual orientation

* Income Inequality

** Income distribution

** (Income) Taxes

** (Possible) inequalities in outputs 

* Participation inequalities

* Healthcare 

* Footnotes
