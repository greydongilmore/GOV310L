** Inequality
- Welcome to the week on inequality
- Or, "life isn't fair"

* Racial Inequality

** History
- Divisions and inequalities across racial groups has been (and
  continues to be) one of the largest sources of inequality in
  American politics 

** History --- Blacks
- Slavery and racism in the US has had a long and lasting impact on
  the socioeconomic status of black people
- Major events:
  - 1787: Three-fifths compromise
  - 1861--1865: Civil War
  - 1863--1877: Reconstruction
  - 1960s: Civil Rights Movement

** Perception of bias
- Black are (unsurprisingly) more likely to say that systematic bias
  exists in our socioeconomic system.
#+BEAMER: \pause 
- For example (2014 General Social Survey): 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
On the average African-Americans have worse jobs, income, and housing
than white people. Do you think these differences are mainly due
to discrimination?
#+END_QUOTE

** Perception of bias

** Today 
The average black person is less well-off than the average white person

|       | Median HH income | Unemployment rate | Poverty rate |
|-------+------------------+-------------------+--------------|
| Black | $35,416          |             11.4% |        27.2% |
| White | $59,754          |              5.3% |         9.7% |

** Education 
- Blacks and Hispanics on average receive lower grades, are more
  likely to drop out, score lower on standardized tests, are less
  likely to enter college, and are less likely to complete college

** Crime
Evidence that much of the criminal justice system is systematically
biased against racial minorities

Example: whites and blacks use drugs at comparable rates, but...[fn:1]

** #BlackLivesMatter 
- Started in 2013 to bring attention to perceived injustices in the
  criminal justice system
- Specifically, that (mostly white) police officers tend to use
  excessive, and/or lethal force on (sometimes unarmed) black people
- Walter Scott: unarmed black man attempting to flee a (white) police
  officer, was shot at least eight times in the back
- Many other such stories from around the country

** #BlackLivesMatter: the data
- Very little data available pertaining to police shootings
- The Washington Post started in 2015 attempting to keep track of
  this: [[https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police-shootings/][link]]
- The WP reports that 990 people were shot and killed by police in 2015
  - 258 were black (26%)
- To 24 April 2016, 305 people shot and killed by police in 2016
  - 71 of whom were black (23%)
- However, large problems with those data: can't get a good picture
  about the context

** Representation

- Historically blacks and Hispanics have not gotten much
  representation in Congress
- First black person elected to Congress in 1870
- Historically, minorities are very under-represented in Congress

** Majority-minority districts
- *Majority-minority district* is one where the majority of residents
  are non-white
- About 113 of the 435 districts today 
- Majority-minority districts one way to increase likelihood of
  minority representation
- Controversial, however... 
#+BEAMER: \pause
- What do you think? 

** Congress today
- The current Congress (114th) is the most diverse to date
- 17% of this Congress is non-white
  - 20% of House, but only 6% of Senate  
  - However, 38% of the US population is non-white

** Congress today
- 35% of black people in the population are represented by a black
  House member[fn:2]
- 22% of Hispanics, 12% of Asians, 8% of Native Americans 

** Map --- Black representation in 2016

** Example: Names
- Researchers sent resume's to employers
- Everything was identical except the person's name
- Lakisha Washington, Jamal Jones, Emily Walsh, and Greg Baker
#+BEAMER: \pause 
- Resume's with white-sounding names received 50 percent more
  callbacks
- Not different among employers who explicitly state that they are
  Equal Opportunity Employers 

* Gender Inequality

** Gender inequality
- Inequalities based on gender
- We aren't focusing on transgendered people even though they are
  faced with inequalities as well

** (quick) history
- Inequalities based on gender have existed throughout US history
- Gradually diminishing, especially since 1900
  - E.g. women now have the right to vote
- Many inequalities remain
  - Occupational
  - Pay gap

** Public opinion
- Generally, public opinion has shifted in favor of men and women equality
- (Problems with asking people what they think)

** Public opinion

better suited emotionally for politics than are most women.

** Pay gap 
- Women on average earn less than men
- In 2013, median weekly income of full-time male workers was $860,
  for females it was $706

** Pay gap
- On average, women make 79 cents for every dollar that a man makes
  doing the same job
- Women make less than men for virtually all occupational categories
  for which we have data 

** Pay gap
- Why?
  - Education, hours worked, experience, occupation, etc
- However, difference still left over after taking that into consideration
- Typically attributed to discrimination
- Other possible explanations:
  - Men more likely to negotiate salary

** Policy on the pay gap
- Current policy allows women who find out that they were receiving
  discriminatory pay to sue and receive recompense within 6 months of
  their last paycheck 
- The *Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act* was passed in 2009

** Occupational 
- Women tend to follow different careers than men do
- Ever seen a male dental hygienist?
- Or a female plumber? 

** STEM 
- Very few women in STEM fields
- Probably due to few women choosing these fields in college
- Women earn the majority (nearly 60%) of bachelor's degrees
- Only ~20% of computer science degrees, engineering, physics

** In representation
- Women historically underrepresented in Congress
- First woman elected to the House in 1917
  - Currently 84 female Reps (19.3%)
- First woman elected to the Senate in 1932
  - Currently 20 female Senators

** Women in Congress

** Quotas 
- Other countries' solution to the gender difference in representation
  is to implement a *quota* which sets aside a certain percentage of
  the seats for women
#+BEAMER: \pause
- What do you think? 

* Inequalities based on gender identity & sexual orientation

** History
- Patchwork of regulations that varies by city/county/state
- Occasionally large advances by Supreme Court decisions
  - 2003: /Lawrence v. Texas/ strikes down anti-sodomy laws
  - 2015: /Obergefell v. Hodges/ recognizes same-sex marriage
- Overall, LGBT rights advocates have been hugely successful over the
  past decade 

** Marriage
- Campaign began in the 1970s, but unsuccessful until 2004 when
  Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage
- Between 2004 & /Obergefell/ 37 states legalized same-sex marriage

** Public opinion

1. Always wrong
2. Almost always wrong
3. Wrong only sometimes
4. Not wrong at all

** Military service 
- "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" was policy 1994--2011
  - Signed by Clinton, repealed by Obama
- Under DADT, openly gay people couldn't serve in the military

** Discrimination
- 22 states outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation
- 19 based on gender identity
- Existing protections under federal laws (Civil Rights Act) gradually
  extended to cover sexual orientation and gender identity

** Other rights
- Texas (and ~30 other states) does not prohibit housing
  discrimination for sexual orientation or gender identity
  - The Dept of Housing and Urban Development prohibits this if the
    housing provider receives HUD funding 
- Texas (and ~30 other states) does not prohibit employment
  discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity

* Income & Wealth Inequality

** Wealth distribution
- How do you think wealth is distributed in the US?
  - Top 20%? Next 20? Mid 20? Next 20? Bottom 20?
- How do you /think/ it should be?

** Wealth distribution

** Distribution in comparative perspective
- Is the US an outlier here?
- What do other comparable countries look like? 

** Distribution in comparative perspective

#+ATTR_LATEX: :float t :width 0.6\textwidth
[[file:../images/us-income-and-wealth-comparative.png]]

** (Income) Taxes
- Taxes can be *progressive* where the tax rate increases as the
  amount increases
  - Example: federal income tax
- Or they can be *regressive* where the tax rate decreases as the
  amount increases
  - Example: sales taxes on essentials like food

** Taxes
- Progressive taxes are one way to shrink this gap
- Other redistributive policies include food stamps and Social Security

** Why progressive taxes?
- The value of an additional dollar decreases with every dollar you
  already have
- So we need to tax dollars at high levels if you already have lots of
  money to make it just as painful as the taxation of a dollar if you
  have few

** Voter ID laws
- Many states have passed Voter ID laws in recent years
- Reason given usually to suppress voter fraud
- However, many poor people & minorities don't have access to proper ID

** Who gets represented?
