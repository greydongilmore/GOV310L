** Inequality
- There are many inequalities in life, based on:
  - Race
  - Gender
  - Sexual orientation or identity
- We'll focus on the simple fact that some people make more than others
- How big are income gaps?
- What ramifications does this have for politics?
** The big questions
- We'll aim to answer a few questions about American politics: 
  - Are the rich running the show?
    - Does public policy respond to the opinions of the richest citizens or the middle citizens?
  - How well are the poorest citizens represented?
* Distribution of income and wealth
** Wealth distribution
- How do you think wealth is distributed in the US?
  - Top 20%? Next 20? Mid 20? Next 20? Bottom 20?
  - Think about how that would look (examples)
- How do you /think/ it should be?

** Wealth distribution

** Distribution in comparative perspective
- Is the US an outlier here?
- What do other comparable countries look like?

** Income inequality 
   - Income inequality is also large in the United States
   - Today, the top 10% of households take home about 30% of the money

** Distribution in historic perspective

* Public policy
** Policy
   - Some policies are designed specifically to limit or shrink income/wealth gaps
** (Income) Taxes
- Taxes can be *progressive* where the tax rate increases as the
  amount increases
  - Example: federal income tax --- your millionth dollar is taxed at a higher rate than your first 
- Or they can be *regressive* where the tax rate decreases as the
  amount increases
  - Example: sales taxes on essentials like food --- since poorer people spend a higher proportion of their money on food, this tax affects them more than richer people

** Taxes
- Progressive taxes are one way to shrink this gap
- Other redistributive policies include food stamps and Social Security

** Why progressive taxes?
- The value of an additional dollar decreases with every dollar you
  already have
- So we need to tax dollars at high levels if you already have lots of
  money to make it just as painful as the taxation of a dollar if you
  have few

** Voter ID laws
- Many states have passed Voter ID laws in recent years
- Reason given usually to suppress voter fraud
- However, many poor people & minorities don't have access to proper ID

* Who gets represented? 

** Concerns about representation
   - Given what we know about the shockingly high levels of economic inequality, you may be concerned about how these show up in the political process
   - After all, rich people have more time & money to give to politicians and campaign committees
   - Maybe this translates into the richest citizens getting their way when it comes to public policy?
     - Especially troubling with regard to tax breaks, etc

** Our task
Our task: to analyze whether (and to what extent) there exists unequal representation based on income 

** Different preferences
   - Having a difference in preferences between rich, middle, poor is important:
     - Without this, difficult to detect differences in representation
     - Without this, limits on consequences of representation 
   - Let's use the General Social Survey to look at this
** Net support by income on different policy areas

** Different data
- The GSS data may not be the best suited to address congruence between policy outputs and preferences across income groups
- Gilens has data on 1,779 potential policies (passed/not passed) and corresponding support/oppose preferences for income groups
- Let's look at how the policy preferences of our three income groups relate to one another
  - What to expect if they're completely unrelated?
  - What to expect if they're completely related?

** Policy support for three income groups

| Middle win |           20 |         67 |         87 |      47% |
| Rich wins  |           58 |         40 |         98 |      53% |
