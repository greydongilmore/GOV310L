** Inequality
- Welcome to the week on inequality
- Or, "life isn't fair"

* Racial Inequality

** History
- Slavery and racism in the US has had a long and lasting impact on
  the socioeconomic status of black people
- Major events:
  - 1787: Three-fifths compromise
  - 1861--1865: Civil War
  - 1863--1877: Reconstruction
  - 1960s: Civil Rights Movement

** Today 
The average black person is less well-off than the average white person

|       | Median HH income | Unemployment rate | Poverty rate |
|-------+------------------+-------------------+--------------|
| Black | 35,416           |             11.4% |        27.2% |
| White | 59,754           |              5.3% |         9.7% |

** Education 
- Blacks and Hispanics on average receive lower grades, are more
  likely to drop out, score lower on standardized tests, are less
  likely to enter college, are less likely to complete college, 

** Crime
- Evidence that much of the criminal justice system is systematically
  biased against racial minorities
#+BEAMER: \pause
- Example: whites and blacks use drugs at comparable rates[fn:1]

** Drug related arrest rates
